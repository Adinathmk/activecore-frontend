## 🔑 Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:

```env
# Backend API base URL
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000/api

# WebSocket URL for real-time notifications
VITE_WS_BASE_URL=ws://localhost:8000/ws

# Stripe publishable key
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

# Google OAuth client ID
VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=xxxxxxxxxxxx.apps.googleusercontent.com
```

> **Note:** Never commit your `.env` file. Add it to `.gitignore`.

## 📜 Available Scripts

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Start local development server with HMR |
| `npm run build` | Build optimized production bundle |
| `npm run preview` | Preview the production build locally |
| `npm run lint` | Run ESLint across the project |

## 🏗️ Architecture

### State Management
The app uses **Redux Toolkit** with a feature-sliced architecture. Each feature owns its slice, async thunks, and RTK Query API definitions — keeping state logic colocated with the feature it belongs to.

### API Layer
A centralized **Axios instance** handles all HTTP requests with:
- Automatic JWT access token injection
- Silent token refresh on 401 responses
- Centralized error normalization via `getErrorMessage.js`

RTK Query is layered on top for declarative data fetching, caching, and cache invalidation.

### Route Guards
Three route guards protect navigation:
- `ProtectedRoute` — Requires authentication
- `PublicOnlyRoute` — Redirects authenticated users away from login/signup
- `RoleProtectedRoute` — Restricts admin routes to users with the `admin` role

### Real-Time Notifications
A custom `notificationSocket.js` service manages the WebSocket lifecycle (connect, reconnect, message dispatch) and integrates with the Redux notification slice to update the UI live.
